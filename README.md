AndroidImageLoader
==================

![Feature Image](https://raw.github.com/wuman/AndroidImageLoader/master/library/src/site/static/feature.png)

AndroidImageLoader is a fork of the 
[Image Loader](http://code.google.com/p/libs-for-android/wiki/ImageLoader) 
component in [libs-for-android](http://code.google.com/p/libs-for-android/).

The AndroidImageLoader is an Android library that helps to load images 
asynchronously. Like its upstream libs-for-android project, it executes
image requests in a thread pool and provides caching support. The following
features of libs-for-android are kept:

* Images are downloaded and saved to cache via a pool of background threads.
* Supports preloading of off-screen images into a memory cache.
* Supports prefetching of images into a disk cache.
* `HttpUrlConnection` is used for loading images, which respects cache control.
* Custom `URLStreamHandlerFactory` is supported for creating connections to
  special URLs such as `content://` URIs.
* Supports `Bitmap` transformations by accepting a `ContentHandler` for loading
  images.

The AndroidImageLoader improves libs-for-android in the following ways:

* In addition to memory cache, the library also supports second level disk caching.
  Caching support in AndroidImageLoader is now made to depend on the
  [TwoLevelLruCache](http://wuman.github.com/TwoLevelLruCache/) library, which in
  turn depends on the more widely used `LruCache` and `DiskLruCache`.
* Image requests are now placed into a LIFO task queue, which makes more sense in
  most scrolling scenarios.
* The API for view binding is now in a separate `ViewBinder` class. Applications
  can use the `ImageViewBinder` class to bind to `ImageView`s or extend the 
  `AbstractViewBinder` class for custom views. Also, `ImageView`s within an
  `AdapterView` no longer require a different kind of binding.
* `OutOfMemoryError`s are automatically detected and caught. When memory is
  running low, the cache size is automatically decreased to give back more
  memory to the system.
* Prefetching can now be supported out of the box via the `SinkContentHandler`
  and the [HttpResponseCache library](https://github.com/candrews/HttpResponseCache).


USAGE
-----

The `ImageLoader` should be installed as a pseudo-system service. This is so that
it can be used as a singleton and accessed across Activities. You do this by
declaring a customized `Application` in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

    public class SamplesApplication extends Application {
        private ImageLoader mImageLoader;

        @Override public void onCreate() {
            super.onCreate();
            try {
                mImageLoader = createImageLoader(this);
            } catch (IOException e) {
            }
        }

        @Override public void onTerminate() {
            mImageLoader = null;
            super.onTerminate();
        }

        @Override public Object getSystemService(String name) {
            if (ImageLoader.IMAGE_LOADER_SERVICE.equals(name)) {
                return mImageLoader;
            } else {
                return super.getSystemService(name);
            }
        }
        
        ...
    }

An example of creating the `ImageLoader` instance can be:

    private static ImageLoader createImageLoader(Context context)
            throws IOException {
        ContentHandler prefetchHandler = null;
        try {
            HttpResponseCache.install(
                    new File(context.getCacheDir(), "HttpCache"),
                    ImageLoader.DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE * 2);
            prefetchHandler = new SinkContentHandler();
        } catch (Exception e) {
        } 

        // Use a custom URLStreamHandlerFactory if special URL scheme is needed
        URLStreamHandlerFactory streamFactory = null;

        // Load images using the default BitmapContentHandler
        ContentHandler bitmapHandler = new BitmapContentHandler();
        bitmapHandler.setTimeout(5000);
        
        return new ImageLoader(
            streamFactory, bitmapHandler, prefetchHandler,
            ImageLoader.DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE, 
            new File(context.getCacheDir(), "images"));        
    }

Obtaining the `ImageLoader` from within an `Activity` is easy:

    ImageLoader imageLoader = ImageLoader.get(context);

Binding an image to `ImageView` is done via `ImageViewBinder`:

    ImageViewBinder binder = new ImageViewBinder(mImageLoader);
    binder.bind(imageView, url);

Optionally you can set alternative images to display:

    binder.setLoadingResource(R.drawable.loading);
    binder.setErrorResource(R.drawable.unavailable);

By default images loaded from disk cache or network are faded in. You can
disable this special effect by:

    binder.setFadeIn(false);

Note that the `ViewBinder` automatically checks whether the target `View` is
still requesting the same URL or already recycled to request another image.

Custom view binding is supported by extending the `AbstractViewBinder<V>` class
and overriding at least the following two methods:

* `void onImageLoaded(V targetView, Bitmap bitmap, String url, LoadSource loadSource)`
* `void onImageError(V targetView, String url, Throwable error)`


SAMPLES
-------

Sample applications are provided to better understand how to use the library.

* _ImageViewBinding_: loading of images using the `ImageViewBinder`.
* _CustomViewBinding_: loading of images into custom views by extending the 
  `AbstractViewBinder` class.
* _FlickrInterestingness_: practical example of loading Flickr images from its 
  Web API using the AndroidImageLoader in combination with the 
  [AndroidFeedLoader](http://wuman.github.com/AndroidFeedLoader/).


INCLUDING IN YOUR PROJECT
-------------------------

There are two ways to include AndroidImageLoader in your projects:

1. You can download the released jar file in the [Downloads section](https://github.com/wuman/AndroidImageLoader/downloads).
2. If you use Maven to build your project you can simply add a dependency to this library.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.wu-man</groupId>
            <artifactId>androidimageloader-library</artifactId>
            <version>0.1</version>
        </dependency>


CONTRIBUTE
----------

If you would like to contribute code to AndroidImageLoader you can do so through 
GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.
